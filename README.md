Original work by Sebastien Guillemette (sebastieng@gmail.com)  

Installation
------------
Download, unzip and stick the two files (`cf.icns` and `cf.keylayout`) in
`/Library/Keyboard` Layouts. Then go to System Prefs, International
(*Language and Text* for Snow users), Input Menu and check off “Canadien
Francais 0.9″. (You may need to log out and back in before the new
layout appears in System Preferences).
